<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve been learning <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> recently.
I’m still very much a novice with the language, so can’t talk much to it but the headline is that it’s a lazy, strongly-typed, purely functional language.
It’s a fascinating language with some really useful features and has the potential to teach us how to write better code in R.</p>
<p>Because Haskell is purely functional, it’s got some interesting ways of working.
For example, there are no loops in Haskell, <code>for</code> isn’t a thing.
This may seem like a massive hole in a language, but Haskell doesn’t need control flow like <code>for</code> since the same outcome can be achieved with recursion and mapping.
These concepts have filtered out into other paradigms in recent years, they are are fundamental functional programming concepts.</p>
<p>I’m not going to write much more about Haskell in this post (but I will in a future post), but learning Haskell has provided a view into a way of working with code and data that is often highly expressive and simple to read.
While there are languages that are ‘functional’ as a defining feature, you can program in a functional style in many languages.
Luckily for us, R <em>is</em> a functional (or at least functional-adjacent) language already and so lessons we learn in Haskell can be brought over to make our R code better.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-does-functional-language-even-mean" class="section level2">
<h2>What does ‘functional language’ even mean?</h2>
<p>The vital element of functional languages is <strong>first class functions</strong>.
This feature is required to make all the other pieces of functional programming possible.
This really means that functions are things that can be passed around like any other value or object.</p>
<p>For example, integers are first-class objects in almost all languages, you can put an integer into a variable, you can pass them into functions or procedures and just by doing so we can build up a pretty good feel for what that means.</p>
<p>In languages that have first class functions, you can do similar things with functions.
For example, in R, let’s define a function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_func &lt;- function(x) {
  x + 1
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a pretty boring function that just adds 1 to its input, but it will suffice to show our point.
The first thing to notice is that we’re using the same operation to give the function a name as we would with any other variable.
This is something that points to R as a functional language, there is no special function declaration statement like in python where we might type something like:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def my_func(x):
  return(x + 1)</code></pre>
<p>Instead the <code>function</code> bit makes a function object and we put it in a box called “<code>my_func</code>” using <code>&lt;-</code>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>We can put it in another box if we want:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new_name &lt;- my_func

new_name(2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>Or we can even pass it into another function as an argument:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>calls_functions_on_10 &lt;- function(f) {
  f(10)
}

calls_functions_on_10(my_func)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 11</code></pre>
<p>We just made a function that accepts <em>another function</em> as an argument and then calls it.
It’s this ability to pass functions to other functions that exemplifies functional languages.</p>
</div>
<div id="in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>In R</h2>
<p>All the learning about functional programming (“FP”) in Haskell made me want to learn more about how to do it effectively in R.</p>
<p>R has a lot of functional abilities from {base}, including things like the <code>*apply</code> family of functions and the <code>Filter</code> and <code>Reduce</code> functions.
But today, I’d like to dip into the {<a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/">purrr</a>} package by Lionel Henry and Hadley Wickham.</p>
<p>This is a tidyverse package that provides common functional patterns with a consistent interface and with a closer attention to output type than functions from {base}.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr)</code></pre>
<div id="map" class="section level3">
<h3><code>map</code></h3>
<p>The most common set of functions I use from {purrr} are the <code>map</code> family.
The best way to learn these is in the relevant <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html">chapter of R for Data Science</a>, but a brief summary is as follows:</p>
<p><code>map</code> encapsulates the idea of doing the same action to every element in a structure.
Where you might want to reach for a for loop, quite often you can do a <code>map</code>.
They are very similar to the <code>*apply</code> family in {base}.</p>
<p>The syntax of <code>map()</code> is fairly simple.
It takes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a data structure with elements (most commonly a <code>list</code> or <code>vector</code>) and</li>
<li>a function that acts on objects corresponding to single elements of that structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>i.e.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map(list, function)</code></pre>
<p>The advantage here is that it means you don’t have to write the infrastructure for your iteration.
Compare the following two code snippets that add one hundred to each element in a list.</p>
<p>First in an “imperative” style:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>the_list &lt;- as.list(1:5)

for (i in seq_along(the_list)) {
  the_list[[i]] &lt;- the_list[[i]] + 100
}

the_list</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] 101
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 102
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 103
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 104
## 
## [[5]]
## [1] 105</code></pre>
<p>and then using map:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>add_100 &lt;- function(x) {x + 100}

map(the_list, add_100)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] 201
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 202
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 203
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 204
## 
## [[5]]
## [1] 205</code></pre>
<p>We’ve defined a function that works on a single element, and <code>map</code> does the job of applying that function to each element of the list.
We tell R <strong>what</strong> to do, not <strong>how</strong> to do it - that’s another common feature of FP.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="other-maps" class="section level3">
<h3>Other <code>map</code>s</h3>
<p>Note in the above example, we got back a list.
That’s the return type of <code>map</code>, but we can also specify what return value we want, e.g. a numeric vector using <code>map_dbl</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map_dbl(the_list, add_100)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 201 202 203 204 205</code></pre>
<p>{purrr} has a consistent naming convention for all the mapping functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>map</code> -&gt; list</li>
<li><code>map_chr</code> -&gt; character vector</li>
<li><code>map_dbl</code> -&gt; numeric vector</li>
<li><code>map_int</code> -&gt; integer vector</li>
<li><code>map_dfr</code> -&gt; data.frame by <strong>row</strong> binding</li>
<li><code>map_dfc</code> -&gt; data.frame by <strong>column</strong> binding</li>
<li><code>map_lgl</code> -&gt; logical (boolean) vector</li>
</ul>
<p>Then if your function takes two inputs that you want to combine you have a copy of the above in the form of <code>map2_*</code> functions, these have a form:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map2(first_list, second_list, f)</code></pre>
<p>And you’ll get back a list with the <code>i</code>th element containing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>f(first_list[[i]], second_list[[i]])</code></pre>
<p>If you’ve got a function that takes multiple arguments you just wrap those in a list and use <code>pmap</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pmap(list(arg1, arg2, ..., argn), f)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="conditional-mapping" class="section level3">
<h3>Conditional Mapping</h3>
<p>You also have ways to only apply the function at certain points, for example, whe a predicate is <code>TRUE</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>the_list &lt;- as.list(1:5)
is_even &lt;- function(x) x %% 2 == 0

map_if(the_list, is_even, add_100)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 102
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 3
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 104
## 
## [[5]]
## [1] 5</code></pre>
<p>Or apply the function at specific indices with <code>map_at</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map_at(the_list, 1:3, add_100)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] 101
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 102
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 103
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 4
## 
## [[5]]
## [1] 5</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="implementing-zip-and-zipwith" class="section level3">
<h3>Implementing <code>zip</code> and <code>zipWith</code></h3>
<p>Zipping is a concept that’s common in Haskell but is even in languages such as Python.
Given two lists<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> of values, e.g.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>list_1 &lt;- c(1,2,3)
list_2 &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We want to produce a new list with like-indexed pairs matched.
I.e. we want to get out something like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new_list &lt;- list(
   list(1, &quot;a&quot;),
   list(2, &quot;b&quot;),
   list(3, &quot;c&quot;)
) </code></pre>
<p><code>zipWith</code> is an extension to <code>zip</code> that will apply a given function to the matching elements when zipping up the lists.</p>
<p>{purrr} and R don’t have a <code>zip</code> function or a <code>zipWith</code> function that will do this, but we can easily make it with <code>map2</code>:</p>
<p>The trick here is noting that <code>zip</code> is just a specific case of the more general <code>zipWith</code> when the function is list appending:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>zip &lt;- function(left, right) {
  map2(left, right, list)
}

zip(list_1, list_2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [[1]][[1]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[1]][[2]]
## [1] &quot;a&quot;
## 
## 
## [[2]]
## [[2]][[1]]
## [1] 2
## 
## [[2]][[2]]
## [1] &quot;b&quot;
## 
## 
## [[3]]
## [[3]][[1]]
## [1] 3
## 
## [[3]][[2]]
## [1] &quot;c&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Or we could do something like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>combine_function &lt;- function(num, letter) {
  paste0(letter, &quot;: &quot;, num)
}

map2(list_1, list_2, combine_function)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] &quot;a: 1&quot;
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] &quot;b: 2&quot;
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] &quot;c: 3&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This code is far terser than the alternative using <code>for</code> loops.
This means that once you understand the <code>map</code> functions, you can read and understand FP code faster since there’s less boiler plate around.
I think so, anyway.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="other-tools-in-purrr" class="section level2">
<h2>Other tools in {purrr}</h2>
<p>Like I said above, I use <code>map</code> and friends frequently.
So frequently in fact that I rarely reach further into {purrr}, but there are some useful functions that I want to highlight.</p>
<div id="accumulation" class="section level3">
<h3>Accumulation</h3>
<p>If you’ve got a data structure that can be iterated over, and you have an operation that works between two elements of the structure you can step wise apply the operation to elements to <code>accumulate</code> the result over time.
This is probably best understood with an example:</p>
<p>We will calculate and show the first 5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number">Triangular Numbers</a>.
These are essentially the sum of all integers below some given integer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
T_k = \sum_{n = 1}^k k = 1 + 2 + ... + k
\]</span></p>
<p>In imperative code (using for loops):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accumulation &lt;- 0
results &lt;- c()
for (i in 1:5) {
  accumulation &lt;- accumulation + i
  results &lt;- c(results, accumulation)
}
results</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  1  3  6 10 15</code></pre>
<p>In FP with {purrr}:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accumulate(1:5, `+`)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  1  3  6 10 15</code></pre>
<p>I think this is so much cleaner.</p>
<p>Just to be totally clear, the above code is doing the following to a list of <code>(1,2,3,4,5)</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first element of the output is just the first value of the input: 1</li>
<li>The second element of the output is the result of applying the function (in this case <code>+</code>) to the most recent calculated value (1) with the second element of the input (2), giving 1 + 2 = 3</li>
<li>The third output element is then the 3 we just calculated + the third element of the input, 3 giving 6</li>
<li>The fourth output element is 6 + 4 = 10</li>
<li>The fifth output element is 10 + 5 = 15</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, obviously there’s a function for this already, the cumulative sum:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cumsum(1:5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  1  3  6 10 15</code></pre>
<p>But perhaps the way to think about this, is that (mathematically at least), cumulative sum is just a special case of accumulation where the accumulating function is <code>+</code>.
Since you can use any function of two arguments in <code>accumulate</code> it’s far more general: by changing the binary operation (the function) you can make new accumulators, e.g. a cumulative divide using <code>/</code> in the place of <code>+</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="reduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Reduction</h3>
<p>I can’t talk about <code>accumulate</code> without talking about <code>reduce</code>.
<code>reduce</code> applies the same logic of <code>accumulate</code> but only gives you back the final result.</p>
<p>For example, calculating a total:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reduce(1:5, `+`)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 15</code></pre>
<p>Concatenating strings</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reduce(1:5, paste)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot;</code></pre>
<p>As for <code>accumulate</code> the trivial examples shown for explanation purposes have their own functions, but <code>reduce</code> captures a general pattern of combining elements with an operation that works on only two elements at a time.</p>
<p>The key requirement for <code>reduce</code> and <code>accumulate</code> is that your operation does not change the type: Addition is fine as <code>+</code> takes two numbers and gives you back a number so it can be used in the next application of <code>+</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="being-defensive" class="section level3">
<h3>Being Defensive</h3>
<p>When <code>map</code>ing over inputs one would hope that the function would work, but to be careful programmers we should be prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>Luckily {purrr} has wrappers for functions that will handle errors. These are called “adverbs” in {purrr} as they modify verbs (the functions that you use in <code>map</code> for example).</p>
<p>They wrap your functions when you put them into <code>map</code>. If your function is represented by <code>f</code>, and these adverbs are represented by <code>adverb</code> then you might write something like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map(list, adverb(f))</code></pre>
<p>They include:</p>
<div id="auto_browse" class="section level4">
<h4><code>auto_browse</code></h4>
<p>This will drop you into the debugger if the function <code>f</code> raises an error.</p>
</div>
<div id="possibly" class="section level4">
<h4><code>possibly</code></h4>
<p>This lets you provide a default value for your function <code>f</code> in the case that it fails. For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fail_on_div_by_zero &lt;- function(x) {
  if (x == 0) {
    stop(&quot;Div by zero error&quot;)
  } else {
    10 / x
  }
}

map(c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2),
    possibly(fail_on_div_by_zero,
             otherwise = 999))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] -5
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] -10
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 999
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 10
## 
## [[5]]
## [1] 5</code></pre>
<p>Useful if we have a function that may fail, and an obvious default value and we want the <code>map</code> to always succeed.</p>
</div>
<div id="quietly" class="section level4">
<h4><code>quietly</code></h4>
<p>If a function prints what it is doing to the console, mapping it over a long list would clutter your console.
You may also want to keep this information.
<code>quietly()</code> wraps your function and collects the output while suppressing any noise.</p>
<p>So while a regular <code>map</code> will return a list where each element is the result of calling <code>f</code> on the element of the list, a function wrapped with <code>quietly</code> will return a list where each element is itself a list of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>result</code>: the result of applying <code>f</code> to the input element, this would be the value shown in the regular use of <code>map</code></li>
<li><code>output</code>: anything printed to the console</li>
<li><code>warnings</code>: anything raised as a <code>warning()</code></li>
<li><code>messages</code>: anything raised as a <code>message()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>noisy_add &lt;- function(x) {
  print(paste(&quot;Adding 10 to:&quot;, x))
  
  if (x == 3) {
    message(&quot;Lucky number 3&quot;)
  }
  
  10 + x
}

map(1:5, quietly(noisy_add))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]

<p>Useful when we want to keep the output around to look at later, but we don’t want it cluttering up the console.</p>
<p>Note that <code>quietly</code> doesn’t handle errors.</p>
</div>
<div id="safely" class="section level4">
<h4><code>safely</code></h4>
<p><code>safely</code> is like <code>quietly</code> but for errors.
It returns a list of lists with elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>result</code>:
<ul>
<li>The value of <code>f</code> on the input if the function works,</li>
<li>NULL otherwise</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>error</code>:
<ul>
<li>NULL if <code>f</code> works</li>
<li>The error object if <code>f</code> fails</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map(c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2),
    safely(fail_on_div_by_zero,
           otherwise = 999))</code></pre>

<p>This is useful when we want the functionality of <code>possibly</code> but we also want to affirmatively detect whether an error was raised.
This is important if we need to be able to distinguish between a true value match the default or when the default was inserted because there was an error.</p>

<div id="keeping-or-discarding-elements" class="section level3">
<h3>Keeping or Discarding Elements</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may have a list or a vector with a load of stuff you want and some items you don’t.</p>
<p>If you have a predicate that is <code>TRUE</code> for things you <strong>want</strong>, use <code>keep</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_values &lt;- 1:10

keep(my_values, is_even)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  2  4  6  8 10</code></pre>

<p>Obviously these two are linked: <code>keep</code> with a predicate that’s <code>TRUE</code> for things you want is the same as <code>discard</code> with a predicate that’s <code>FALSE</code> for things you want.</p>
<p>I’d say use whichever best describes your intention:
Sometimes your intention will be something like “keep all the items that satisfy a condition” and sometimes it will be “get rid of all the items with this characteristic”.</p>

<li><code>cross</code> does the matching between pairs, giving us back a list of all pairings</li>
<li><code>map</code> is then used to apply a function that multiplies the two elements of a list together</li>
<li>then we make it into a matrix using <code>matrix</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There are quite a few instances when <code>cross</code> (or the related function <code>crossing()</code> from {tidyr}) is useful for making grids to search over an n-dimensional parameter space.
Or if you have a function of two variables that you want to show as a surface plot, you can generate all the (x,y) coordinate pairs using <code>cross</code>.</p>

<div id="lifting-domains-of-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Lifting domains of functions</h3>
<p>In R there are three common ways to accept inputs into a function:</p>
<ul>
<li>Named arguments, e.g. <code>f(arg1 = 1, arg2 = 2, arg3 = 3)</code> (which also covers <code>...</code>) (type <code>d</code>)</li>
<li>As a list e.g. <code>f(list(1,2,3))</code> (type <code>v</code>)</li>
<li>As a vector e.g. <code>f(c(1,2,3))</code> (type <code>c</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>lift*</code> family provide wrapping functions that translate functions that take arguments a certain way into functions that take arguments another way.</p>
<p>The <code>lift</code> family has a number of functions that are named like <code>lift_xy</code>.
This will take a function that accepts arguments the way of <code>x</code> and returns a function that accepts arguments the way of <code>y</code>.
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> can take any (different) values from <code>d</code>, <code>v</code> and <code>c</code>.
For example, <code>lift_dv()</code>.</p>
<p>This is useful when you have data structured one way, but need to use a function that takes arguments in a different way.
One option would be to transform your data to match your function, but that could be hard.
It may be easier to transform your function to match your data.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s say we have data that is structured as a nested list:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_data &lt;- list(
  list(number = 1, text = &quot;This is number one&quot;),
  list(number = 2, text = &quot;This is number two&quot;),
  list(number = 100, text = &quot;This is number 100&quot;)
)</code></pre>
<p>Then we have a function that takes named arguments:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_describer &lt;- function(number, text) {
  paste(number, &quot;:&quot;, text)
}</code></pre>
<p>We can write code like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_describer(number = 10, text = &quot;Hello ten&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;10 : Hello ten&quot;</code></pre>
<p>So we might try to <code>map</code> over our data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map(my_data, my_describer)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error in paste(number, &quot;:&quot;, text): argument &quot;text&quot; is missing, with no default</code></pre>
<p>And we get the error because <code>my_describer</code> expects two arguments and we’ve only given it one (the second-level list in <code>my_data</code>).</p>
<p>We note that our function takes named values but we want to apply it to a list, so we can <code>lift</code> the domain of the function to lists using <code>lift_dl</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map(my_data, lift_dl(my_describer))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] &quot;1 : This is number one&quot;
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] &quot;2 : This is number two&quot;
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] &quot;100 : This is number 100&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This can useful for composing functions together into larger chains when the output of one function may produce a list, but the next function in a chain expects named arguments.</p>
</div>
<div id="partial-application" class="section level3">
<h3>Partial Application</h3>
<p>Partial Application is the process of taking a function of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> variables, filling in <span class="math inline">\(k&lt;n\)</span> of them and getting a new function out the end that takes the remaining <span class="math inline">\(n-k\)</span> variables.</p>
<p>More concretely, say we have a function defined as so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>combine_three &lt;- function(x, y, z) {
  paste0(x, &quot;, &quot;, y, &quot;, and &quot;, z)
}

combine_three(&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;oranges&quot;, &quot;pears&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;apples, oranges, and pears&quot;</code></pre>
<p>which takes three values.</p>
<p>We can make a new function that is a version of this function but has two variables fixed.
There’s a verbose, obvious way and a {purrr} way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>verbose_way &lt;- function(z) {
  combine_three(x = &quot;apples&quot;, &quot;oranges&quot;, z)
}
verbose_way(&quot;elephants&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;apples, oranges, and elephants&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>purrr_way &lt;- partial(combine_three,
                     x = &quot;apples&quot;,
                     y = &quot;pears&quot;)
purrr_way(&quot;mice&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;apples, pears, and mice&quot;</code></pre>
<p>These produce (basically) the same thing, but the version made with <code>partial</code>, I think, shows intention more clearly; the verbose way is the nuts and bolts of defining a totally new function and you only understand by reading the full definition that we are doing partial application, whereas in the {purrr} way, you know this going in when you read <code>partial</code>.</p>
<p>Code that shows its intention clearly is better code.</p>
<p>I use this when there’s a function from a package that has a great many options and I know that for a certain use case I want to fill some of those in and ‘set’ them in advance.</p>
<p>It works on any function, so that <code>add_100</code> function from before could be defined as:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>add_100 &lt;- partial(`+`, 100)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="compose" class="section level3">
<h3><code>compose</code></h3>
<p>With the popularity of the tidyverse many R programmers have got used to piping data through multiple functions.
So much so that R4.1 introduced the native pipe, <code>|&gt;</code>.
But these still take need some data in the front<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Often in full functional languages like Haskell, we will make new functions out of smaller functions without even referencing the inputs.
This “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming">point-free</a>” style <em>can</em> lead to more expressive and clearer code.</p>
<p>This is done through <strong>composition</strong> of functions.</p>
<p>In mathematics if we have a function <span class="math inline">\(f : x \to y\)</span> and a function <span class="math inline">\(g: y\to z\)</span> (here <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> just denote the domains of the functions), we can make a new function <span class="math inline">\(g \circ f : x \to z\)</span>, read “g after f”, that is a function in its own right. It defines a mapping that is the same as doing <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, then doing <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> to the result, i.e. <span class="math inline">\((g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))\)</span> with some input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note how we had to introduce an input in the final definition there, whereas before this we were just talking about functions in an abstract way without considering specific inputs.</p>
<p>It turns out we can do the same thing with R code to take a handful of simple functions and build them up to something larger.</p>
<p>So let’s built a function that will</p>
<ul>
<li>take a string of numbers, e.g. “1 2 3 4 5”</li>
<li>split the string by spaces</li>
<li>convert the list of strings into a list of numbers</li>
<li>add 100 to each number</li>
<li>keep only those greater than 103</li>
<li>return the product</li>
</ul>
<p>By writing out the steps, we essentially list the simple functions we will need to compose.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># take the very first element of a list
take_first &lt;- function(l) {
  l[[1]]
}

# Predicate function, TRUE only if input  is larger than 103
greater_than_103 &lt;- function(x) {
  x &gt; 103
}

fancy_pipeline &lt;-
  compose(
    partial(stringr::str_split, pattern = &quot; &quot;),
    take_first,
    as.numeric,
    add_100,
    partial(keep, .p=greater_than_103),
    prod,
    .dir = &quot;forward&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<p>We’ve used <code>partial</code> a couple of times to partially apply some of the functions we have defined.
But overall, this expresses our process clearly as a series of steps.
By specifying <code>.dir = "forward"</code> we override the default ‘mathematical’ order for defining the steps and can input them in the order that they touch the data.</p>
<p>On an input string “1 2 3 4 5”, this will produce 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, which will be filtered down into 104, 105, the product of which is 10920.
We can use our function to get the same answer:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fancy_pipeline(&quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 10920</code></pre>
<p>If we look at the function, we can still see how it was made:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fancy_pipeline</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &lt;composed&gt;
## 1. &lt;partialised&gt;
## function (...) 
## stringr::str_split(pattern = &quot; &quot;, ...)
## 
## 2. function(l) {
##   l[[1]]
## }
## 
## 3. function (x, ...) 
## .Primitive(&quot;as.double&quot;)(x, ...)
## 
## 4. &lt;partialised&gt;
## function (...) 
## 100 + ...
## 
## 5. &lt;partialised&gt;
## function (...) 
## keep(.p = greater_than_103, ...)
## 
## 6. function (..., na.rm = FALSE) 
## .Primitive(&quot;prod&quot;)(..., na.rm = na.rm)</code></pre>
<p>Functional composition lets us define large functions from smaller (simpler and therefore easier to test) sub-functions and be explicit about how the larger functions are constructed.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While <code>map</code> is still my most commonly used function from {purrr}, looking in more detail at the offerings of the package has been fascinating.
I’ve only covered a few items here, so I would recommend the reader look more at the purrr NAMESPACE and see what else it has to offer.</p>
<p>There’s a whole lot of benefits to adopting a functional style including clearer and more expressive code that’s easier to test.
While R still has a lot of distance to cover to catch up to Haskell (and it’s not trying to anyway), you can still adopt an FP style in your R code either with base or with {purrr}. I’m certainly going to continue looking for opportunities to simplify my code using <code>lift</code>s or <code>partial</code> or bolstering my <code>maps</code> using <code>possibly</code> or <code>safely</code>.</p>
