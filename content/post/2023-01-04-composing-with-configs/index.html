<p>There are two things that are important to keep in mind reading this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Writing pure functions is helpful for a whole load of reasons.</li>
<li>Being able to compose smaller functions into a larger whole is a really good way to build complex processes</li>
</ol>
<p>And a third one:</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sometimes over-engineering something is fun and helps you learn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Today, we‚Äôre going to discuss a way to handle a computation that is performed in some environment.
By ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù, I mean some set of configuration settings.
The situation would be that we want to define some process that takes an input and some settings and then manipulates the input with reference to the settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different input, same settings: different output</li>
<li>Same input, different settings: also different output</li>
</ul>
<p>But the idea is that your settings are conceptually different from your inputs.
E.g. a config file vs actual data or something like that.</p>
<p>You could build your environment to be some complex object, but I‚Äôm going to simply use a list:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>e1 &lt;- list(a = 2, b = 4, c = 5)</code></pre>
<p>Each element of the list is some parameter that we want to have available in our computation.</p>
<p>But we‚Äôd like to do it by composing pure functions.</p>
<div id="first-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>First Steps</h2>
<p>The first and easiest way to take advantage of this environment is to simply define functions that reference their parent scope.
R is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#R">lexically scoped</a> language.
Basically, functions in R know where they were <em>defined</em> and can access variables in that location.
If we define this a function like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>uses_global_variables &lt;- function(x) {
  x + e1$a
}</code></pre>
<p>We take in an argument, <code>x</code>, but also use the <code>a</code> value from <code>e1</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>uses_global_variables(2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>uses_global_variables(10)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 12</code></pre>
<p>This has some upsides:</p>
<p>Firstly, it‚Äôs easily composed<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>uses_global_variables_twice &lt;- purrr::compose(
  uses_global_variables,
  uses_global_variables
)

uses_global_variables_twice(2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6</code></pre>
<p>Or perhaps</p>
<pre class="r"><code>2 |&gt;
  uses_global_variables() |&gt;
  uses_global_variables()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6</code></pre>
<p>Secondly, depending on your context, you could change a value in <code>e1</code>, load it into your session again, and <code>uses_global_variables()</code> would know immediately the new value of <code>a</code> to use.</p>
<p>But that could also be a downside.
This reliance on something defined <em>externally</em> to the function means that it‚Äôs a <strong>impure</strong> function.
I.e. it is not a ‚Äòpure function‚Äô.</p>
<p>As a recap, pure functions are functions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given any particular input, they will always return the same input</li>
<li>They do not have any ‚Äòside effects‚Äô.
This essentially means that they don‚Äôt read/write to files, they don‚Äôt have interaction with the user, they don‚Äôt throw errors etc.
Strictly speaking, they wouldn‚Äôt even write to a console.</li>
</ul>
<p>A heuristic for whether a function is pure is whether you could memoise it.
Essentially, could you skip calculations and just look the answer up in a big reference table and the caller would be none the wiser?
Writing as much of your program as you can with pure functions is generally a good strategy since pure functions are easy to reason about.</p>
<p>Anything pure functions use, they will take in as an argument so all the ‚Äúentry points‚Äù for information are right there in the function definition.
They rely on nothing that‚Äôs outside the function definition (i.e.¬†nothing that can change without redefining the function - you <em>can</em> rely on functions from external libraries etc<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>).</p>
<p>A pure version of <code>uses_global_variables()</code> would be:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>takes_e_locally &lt;- function(x, e) {
  x + e$a
}</code></pre>
<p>And this produces the same output as <code>uses_global_variables()</code>, though we also have to pass in the environment <code>e</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>takes_e_locally(2, e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>takes_e_locally(10, e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 12</code></pre>
<p>Pure functions are also easier to test.
If we wanted to test <code>uses_global_variables()</code> against some expected output, we‚Äôd need to get an <code>e1</code> from somewhere and inject it in somehow.
But in contrast, we can test <code>takes_e_locally()</code> simply by passing in some <code>e</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>testthat::test_that(&quot;takes_e_locally works&quot;, {
  etest &lt;- list(a = 1)
  
  testthat::expect_equal(
    takes_e_locally(x = 2, e = etest),
    3
  )
})</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Test passed üòÄ</code></pre>
<p>So <code>takes_e_locally()</code> passes the purity test.
But we‚Äôve just lost something that <code>uses_global_variables()</code> had:
(convenient) composability.</p>
<p>As the input to the function is a value and an environment to use, but the output is just a number we can‚Äôt compose it the same way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>takes_e_locally_twice &lt;- purrr::compose(
  takes_e_locally,
  takes_e_locally
)

takes_e_locally_twice(2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error in `_fn`(2): argument &quot;e&quot; is missing, with no default</code></pre>
<p>We‚Äôd need to keep passing in the environment to every function we call.
We <em>could</em> do it like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>takes_e_locally(2, e1) |&gt;
  takes_e_locally(e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6</code></pre>
<p>But that repetition of <code>e1</code> means we need to pass it to <em>every</em> function in the chain that might need it and it could cause issues if we want to change the reference to some <code>e2</code>, but we forget one <code>e1</code> in the chain.
It would be better to be able to only pass in the environment config once and have the chain be aware of it, providing it to the functions automatically.</p>
</div>
<div id="making-things-more-complicated-to-make-them-simpler" class="section level2">
<h2>Making things more complicated to make them simpler</h2>
<p>Bear with me here, things will get a <em>little</em> more complicated before they get simpler, but it‚Äôs worth the effort.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice about <code>takes_e_locally()</code> (a function of two arguments) is that we can re-write this into a function that takes one argument but itself returns another function that takes another argument:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>takes_e_locally_curried &lt;- function(x) {
  function(e) {
    x + e$a
  }
}

takes_e_locally_curried(2)(e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<p>This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curried function</a>.</p>
<p>As shown above, we can evaluate the function with these double brackets: <code>takes_e_locally_curried(2)</code> produces a function which we then pass <code>e1</code> to and we get back the result.</p>
<p><code>takes_e_locally_curried(2)</code> essentially defines a computational process that, given some environment, carries out that computational process <em>in the context of that environment</em>.</p>
<p>We will call this first stage (before passing in an environment) a ‚Äúreader‚Äù, as we get back a function that ‚Äúreads‚Äù from the environment <code>e</code> that we pass it.</p>
<p>To make it a little easier, and avoid double parentheses, let‚Äôs make a function that runs a reader for us:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>run_reader &lt;- function(reader, e) {
  reader(e)
}

my_reader &lt;- takes_e_locally_curried(2)

run_reader(my_reader, e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<p>And it‚Äôs easy to do the <em>same</em> computational process in another environment:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>e2 &lt;- list(a = 4, b = 6, c = 7)
run_reader(my_reader, e2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6</code></pre>
<p>Same process, different config, different answer.</p>
<p>So say we have the following functions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fun_a &lt;- function(x, e) {
  x + e$a
}

fun_b &lt;- function(x, e) {
  x + e$b
}

fun_c &lt;- function(x, e) {
  x + e$c
}</code></pre>
<p>Remember, we want to be able to build a complex computation out of smaller parts (i.e.¬†we want to use composition) and we don‚Äôt want to have to pass <code>e1</code> in each time.</p>
<p>For now, let‚Äôs curry these into corresponding readers:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reader_a &lt;- function(x) {
  function(e) {
    x + e$a
  }
}

reader_b &lt;- function(x) {
  function(e) {
    x + e$b
  }
}

reader_c &lt;- function(x) {
  function(e) {
    x + e$c
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>We are going to define a new pipe that knows how to deal with these reader functions.
We‚Äôll call this pipe, ‚Äúbind‚Äù.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>`%&gt;&gt;=%` &lt;- function(lhs, rhs) {
  function(e) {
    a &lt;- run_reader(lhs, e)
    rb &lt;- rhs(a)
    run_reader(rb, e)
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a little complex, so let‚Äôs break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is going to be used as an infix function, we‚Äôre going to expect a reader on the left hand side (e.g.¬†<code>reader_a(2)</code>) and the rest of the process on the right (some other function relying on the environment, i.e.¬†another reader).</li>
<li>Note that bind is going to return a function that accepts some environment, i.e.¬†the output will itself be a reader.</li>
<li>But this isn‚Äôt quite like the other readers we‚Äôve already defined:
<ul>
<li>once it is passed an environment, it runs the left hand side reader in that environment and stores the value in a variable, <code>a</code>.</li>
<li>It then creates a new reader with an input of <code>a</code>.</li>
<li>The return value is this new reader evaluated in the environment passed in to the inner function.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôll define one other function first.
I‚Äôd like to call this <code>return</code> for reasons that I won‚Äôt go into here, but <code>return</code> is a defined keyword in R, so let‚Äôs just stick with <code>pure</code> for now, again for reasons that I won‚Äôt go into.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pure &lt;- function(x) {
  function(e) {
    x
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a way of injecting our input into the reader context.
Essentially this makes a reader function (a function accepting an environment), that ignores its environment and just returns the value.
Not that useful in general, but very useful for starting off a composition of readers.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at an example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>run_reader(pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% reader_a, e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<p>Let‚Äôs break down the first argument, i.e.¬†the definition of the reader.
We know we can rewrite this as:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>`%&gt;&gt;=%`(pure(2), reader_a)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## function(e) {
##     a &lt;- run_reader(lhs, e)
##     rb &lt;- rhs(a)
##     run_reader(rb, e)
##   }
## &lt;bytecode: 0x55d314742d78&gt;
## &lt;environment: 0x55d3145e5460&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Using the definition of <code>%&gt;&gt;=%</code>, this expands to:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function(e) {
  a &lt;- run_reader(pure(2), e)
  rb &lt;- reader_a(a)
  run_reader(rb, e)
}</code></pre>
<p>We know that <code>run_reader(pure(2), e)</code>, must return <code>2</code>, regardless of the environment, <code>e</code>, as <code>pure</code> ignores the environment and returns the value.
We substitute:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function(e) {
  a &lt;- 2
  rb &lt;- reader_a(2)
  run_reader(rb, e)
}</code></pre>
<p>This then boils down to:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function(e) {
  run_reader(reader_a(2), e)
}</code></pre>
<p>If we pass in <code>e1</code> as <code>e</code>, we get:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>run_reader(reader_a(2), e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<p>As expected.</p>
<p>This one is a little more complex:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>run_reader(pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% reader_a %&gt;&gt;=% reader_b, e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<p>Again, let‚Äôs take the reader part:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% reader_a %&gt;&gt;=% reader_b</code></pre>
<p>It turns out that it only works if we have left-associativity i.e.¬†we can parcel it up like</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% reader_a) %&gt;&gt;=% reader_b</code></pre>
<p>but not</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% (reader_a %&gt;&gt;=% reader_b)</code></pre>
<p>Luckily, we already know what</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% reader_a</code></pre>
<p>gives:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function(e) {
  run_reader(reader_a(2), e)
}</code></pre>
<p>Which, for simplicity, I‚Äôll rewrite as:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>\(e) {reader_a(2)(e)}</code></pre>
<p>So substituting this in to the definition of <code>%&gt;&gt;=%</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function(e) {
  a &lt;- run_reader(\(e) {reader_a(2)(e)}, e)
  rb &lt;- reader_b(a)
  run_reader(rb, e)
}</code></pre>
<p>Expanding:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function(e) {
  run_reader(reader_b(reader_a(2)(e)), e)
}</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function(e) {
  reader_b(reader_a(2)(e))(e)
}</code></pre>
<p>Then using the definition of <code>reader_a()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function(e) {
  reader_b(2 + e$a)(e)
}</code></pre>
<p>Then the definition of <code>reader_b()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function(e) {
  2 + e$a + e$b
}</code></pre>
<p>So now we‚Äôve gone through all of that to show our composition of a readers <code>pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% reader_a %&gt;&gt;=% reader_b</code> is itself a reader function (a function that takes an <code>e</code> environment and evaluates some computation in that environment).
So:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>run_reader(pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% reader_a %&gt;&gt;=% reader_b, e1)</code></pre>
<p>evaluates to 8 as expected:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>2 + e1$a + e2$a</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="cleaning-things-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Cleaning things up</h2>
<p>That did get a little complicated.
Let‚Äôs recap where we‚Äôve got to, and why we started in the first place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two things are important:
<ul>
<li>pure functions are easier to deal with</li>
<li>composition is powerful</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Without resorting to something fancy, if we want to be able to define a more complex calculation that refers to some config environment, we can have purity but not composition or composition without purity.</li>
<li>But we curried our function and with a suitable definition of a special pipe infix function, <code>%&gt;&gt;=%</code>, we got both at the expense of having to use <code>run_reader()</code> to run the calculation.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I don‚Äôt want to have to write all my functions in the curried way.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd prefer to write single level functions, i.e.¬†functions of two arguments and have the pipe handle the currying and uncurrying.
Luckily, that‚Äôs fairly simple with this small addition to <code>%&gt;&gt;=%</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>`%&gt;&gt;=%` &lt;- function(reader, rhs) {
  function(e) {
    a &lt;- run_reader(reader, e)
    rb = purrr::partial(rhs, a)
    run_reader(rb, e)
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Then we can use the uncurried <code>fun_a()</code>, <code>fun_b()</code> and <code>fun_c()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>run_reader(pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% fun_a %&gt;&gt;=% fun_b, e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<p>The final thing we want to do is allow functions that don‚Äôt take a the environment.
At the moment, we get an error:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>just_adds_1 &lt;- function(x) {
  x + 1
}

run_reader(pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% just_adds_1 %&gt;&gt;=% fun_b, e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error in (function (x) : unused argument (list(2, 4, 5))</code></pre>
<p>Because we‚Äôre trying to force the environment into the function where there‚Äôs no where for it to go.</p>
<p>We need to write a handler for this function</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wrapper &lt;- function(f) {
  function(x, e) {
    f(x)
  }
}

run_reader(pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=% wrapper(just_adds_1) %&gt;&gt;=% fun_b, e1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 7</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="why-not-just-use-with" class="section level2">
<h2>Why not just use <code>with</code>?</h2>
<p>We could have done this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>with(list(e = e1),
     2 |&gt;            # pure(2) %&gt;&gt;=%
     fun_a(e) |&gt;     # fun_a
       fun_b(e))     # fun_b</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<p>Which sort of lets us compose (at least in the pipe way, if not the mathematical, point-free way), and means there‚Äôs only one place to change the <code>e</code>.
It‚Äôs also simpler to read, as you only need to get your head around <code>with</code> rather than <code>%&gt;&gt;=%</code> etc.</p>
<p>For actual use, probably go with <code>with</code> or some other system for managing global configs.</p>
<p>But you should have learned by now that coming here for useful tips won‚Äôt always work out that way.
Playing around with functions and evaluation and pipes exposes interesting new ways to program.
This post was inspired by the Reader monad in Haskell.
And it wasn‚Äôt really until I started reading <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/about/">Bartosz Milewski‚Äôs</a> book <a href="https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf">Category Theory for Programmers</a> and tried to implement it in R that I really started to get how it worked.
Disclaimer: I‚Äôm sure someone more knowledgeable about it than I am can find some misunderstanding or some subtlety I‚Äôve missed, so don‚Äôt take Reader monad advice from this blog, do your own research!</p>
