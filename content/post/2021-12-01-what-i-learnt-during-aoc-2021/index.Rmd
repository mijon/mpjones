# Introduction

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) happened during December.
This post covers things I learnt over the course of the month.

# Day 1

## R

I had never heard of the `diff` function before. 
I wrote my own, but there was a perfect function right in {base}.
Clearly I need to explore {base} more and rely on {tidyverse} a little less.
For example, my solution is [here](https://github.com/mijon/AoC2021/blob/main/R/day_1.R), but [this](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/rstats-adventofcode/blob/master/2021/01-1.R) solution from [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://twitter.com/Emil_Hvitfeldt/) exemplifies how simple the R solution can be.

I also never heard about the {slider} package.
Perfect for the rolling sum needed for part 2.

## APL

I struggled to hack together something for APL using a mix of rotates and reduces.
I did not know about windowed reduces.
I didn't come up with this solution, but isn't it beautiful, with our values in an array `d` we solve part 1 with just:

```
+/2</d
```

Reading from the right, `2</d` does a length-2 windowed reduce on our array `d` using the `<` function (less than, surprisingly when it comes to APL, this is the same as in other languages).

On the sample data, this produces:

```
2</sample_data
  1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
```

i.e. a 1 (true in APL) whenever the right of the pair is less than the left.

Then we just need to sum that using a normal plus-reduce, `+/`.

The extension to the third problem is just to add another windowed reduce:

```
+/2</3+/d
```

I'm still terrible at APL, but I like it's terseness.
