<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago, I attended GIRO, the IFoA’s General Insurance conference.
It was my first GIRO and generally I found it very thought-provoking.</p>
<p>There were a range of topics presented, but a major theme running through the conference was that Data Science and artificial intelligence<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>My favourite session was a talk from <a href="https://www.lambdadtd.com/about">Thomas Hamilton</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
It was entitled “Building Systems that Last” and Hamilton spoke to the emerging (or perhaps crystallising) role of the actuary as a systems builder.
He spoke on a range of specifics, like database design, domain driven design, thinking with types, and how to name things.</p>
<p>At the end of the talk I asked a question along the lines of ‘given how much you’ve spoken about Types, domain driven design, and system safety, I’d be interested in your view on whether the actuarial profession should favour languages like F#, Julia, and Rust, over languages like Python and R’.
And even if he did have some negative views on using R in production, his response was interesting, but I took his view (and it’s been a while since the presentation, so I may not be doing it justice) to be around Python + type annotations is probably fine.</p>
<p>But it left me thinking: As some actuaries start to build more complex systems, are we actually using the right tools to do so? Are the right tools out there already? What would the ideal tool look like?</p>
</div>
<div id="lay-of-the-land" class="section level1">
<h1>Lay of the land</h1>
<p>Since the 2019 curriculum change, all student actuaries sitting the IFoA exams will have at least some exposure to programming in R (though I have my reservations about the content of those exams, that’s a discussion for another time).
Many companies will have more experienced actuaries with knowledge of R already, or perhaps Python, or a deep understanding of SQL or whatever.</p>
<p>But while Python and R are friendly languages to work in, I think there are legitimate criticisms of both in large scale ‘production’ systems.
Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s possible to use both in production, but it requires an additional layer of considerations to do so effectively.</p>
<p>I know of at least one large consultancy that uses F# extensively.
I’ve also found it interesting that trading giant Jane Street uses OCaml almost exclusively<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and for many of the reasons that I will talk about below.
There’s also stories of the old days when APL was a language of actuaries, though I think you’ll struggle to find many people calculating their Solvency II capital with APL these days.</p>
<p>And obviously, you have companies using specific tools for running calculations like Tyche, Remetrica, Igloo and the rest.</p>
<p>But no matter what mainstream language actuaries use currently, we’re making do with tools for other uses.
I think it would be fun to think about what an ideal tool would look like.</p>
<p>I’m not advocating for anyone to actually build this language, but by thinking about what features would be useful, it can help select the right tool from what is available now.</p>
</div>
<div id="desirable-features" class="section level1">
<h1>Desirable Features</h1>
<div id="algebraic-data-types" class="section level2">
<h2>Algebraic Data Types</h2>
<p>This one’s going first in the list for a reason.</p>
<p>Since I started learning Haskell and later Rust, there’s been one key feature that I wish I had available in other languages: A proper sum type.</p>
<p>Most languages will have product types:
These are ways of combining a collection of values into a single block to carry around.
For example, we could make a data structure to represent a pension.
This data structure would have things like</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of type <code>String</code></li>
<li>Date of birth of type <code>Date</code></li>
<li>Sex of type <code>Int</code> (if using a 0/1 coding), or perhaps <code>String</code> (“Male”, “Female”, …)</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Now, to make an instance of the <code>Pension</code> data structure, you have to provide a value for each of the fields.
And so the total number of unique possible instances is related to the total number of each possible value:</p>
<p>Number of <code>Pension</code> objects = Number of possible Names * number of possible dates of birth etc…</p>
<p>Hence why it’s called a “product type”.
Product types can be thought of as a value of one type <strong>and</strong> a value of another <strong>and</strong> a value of another etc:
a <code>Pension</code> is a name <strong>and</strong> a date <strong>and</strong> a sex.</p>
<p>But only some languages offer a sum type.
This is a type that can be one of a range of possible values.
Think of them as a value of one sort <strong>or</strong> a value of another.</p>
<p>In the above example, actually, there’s a key feature that lends itself well to sum types: Sex<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.
If we model sex as a binary, then clearly using an integer or a string means that we have to do a lot more checking as <em>at the level of types</em>, a string could be any collection of characters, an integer any number, beyond the subset of values we assign meaning to (i.e. sure we can have “M” and “F” to encode the sex of our pensioner, but the structure of the program doesn’t preclude putting in any other string).</p>
<p>If we want to protect against bad data, then we will need to keep checking (possibly at multiple stages) that we are dealing with a string that is valid in our domain.
That is, <strong>we</strong> will have to check that as the authors of the code, we can’t leave it up to the computer.</p>
<p>However, if we can encode into the type system that <code>sex</code> can only take on a limited number of values, then we can be sure that if we have a value of <code>sex</code>, we know the finite number of cases to deal with.</p>
<p>We can make better systems because we can constrain the possible values of our types, and use automated tools to check these types are being used correctly.</p>
<p>ADTs provide you with tools to model more closely to the domain.
Generally languages with ADTs have simple ways to define them, i.e. not cluttered up with too much programming.</p>
<p>e.g. in Haskell</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>data LineOfBusiness = Motor
                    | EmployersLiability 
                    | PublicLiability</code></pre>
<p>Or in Rust:</p>
<pre class="rust"><code>enum LineOfBusiness = {
    Motor,
    EmployersLiability,
    PublicLiability,
}</code></pre>
<p>This means that you can quite easily show your type definitions to a non-coder who is a domain expert and they can easily spot if anything is missing.
This is a key point in <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/">Domain Modelling Made Functional</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="powerful-type-system" class="section level2">
<h2>Powerful Type System</h2>
<p>That leads me on to the next desirable feature, static typing.</p>
<p>Languages like R and Python are dynamically typed.
That means that functions can accept values of a range of types automatically and they are coerced behind the scenes.
It’s the “if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s a duck” idea.</p>
<p>This leads to faster development time because you don’t have to fight with a type checker or write type annotations, but your functions only know what sort of values you get at runtime.</p>
<p>With static typing, however, you have to state all the types that your function works with in advance.
While this constrains you, it also constrains the types of errors you can get.</p>
<p>It also means that you can be warned if you haven’t accounted for all possible cases.
Rust, Haskell, and other languages will shout at you if you write a function that takes a sum type and does something different for each branch, but you don’t write a case for all the branches.</p>
<p>E.g. if you have a sum type that defines each possible head of damage a policy can have claims under, and you write a function that will do something different depending on each head of damage, it would be a nice feature for the language to let you know when you’ve missed a HoD from your logic.
Even better if later on you add a HoD and the computer tells you all of the places in your code you have to handle this new case before you ever run the program.
This is possible in a language that has strong static analysis features.</p>
<p>Static typing helps you find your mistakes before a user uses your program.
It helps you ensure that the system you build has covered all the corner cases.</p>
<p>An option would be Julia’s paradigm of overloaded functions and multiple dispatch.
It’s very easy in Julia to define functions that work on very specific sets of types, alongside functions that work on a wider, more general set.</p>
<p>As an example of how this might be useful, consider money in multiple currencies.
A common approach might be to store this in a two column data frame (currency label as a string and amount as a float or integer), or perhaps in a two element tuple.
However, when you have Julia’s system you can encode the currency into the types.</p>
<pre class="julia"><code># Define a top-level abstract type so you can talk
# about &#39;currencies&#39; generally 
abstract type Currency end

# Define as many currencies as exist in your domain
# as types themselves. We&#39;ll just handle integers
# at the moment. They are all concrete subtypes
# of `Currency`
struct Usd &lt;: Currency
  amount::Int
end

struct Gbp &lt;: Currency
  amount::Int
end

# Then we can define a function to add two currencies
# But *only* if they are the same currency:
add_currency(a::T, b::T) where {T &lt;: Currency} =
  T(a.amount + b.amount)</code></pre>
<p>Here we’ve defined an abstract type called <code>Currency</code> that relates all our concrete types (<code>Usd</code> and <code>Gbp</code>), but that we can never make a value of.
We <em>can</em> make values of the concrete types, however.</p>
<p>We also define a way to add two currencies.
We do this with parametric types, (the <code>T</code> above).
We make constraints that <code>T</code> must be a subtype of <code>Currency</code>, <em>and</em> that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> must be the <strong>same</strong> subtype.
Adding two of the same currencies together works and gives back a value of that currency.</p>
<p>Therefore we can do things like:</p>
<pre class="julia"><code>gbp1 = Gbp(100)
gbp2 = Gbp(200)

add_currency(gbp1, gbp2)
# Gbp(300)</code></pre>
<p>But if we do the following we’ll get an error:</p>
<pre class="julia"><code>usd1 = Usd(500)
add_currency(gbp1, usd1)

# ERROR: MethodError: no method matching add_currency2(::Usd, ::Gbp)
# 
# Closest candidates are:
#   add_currency2(::T, ::T) where T&lt;:Currency
#    @ Main REPL[14]:1

# Stacktrace:
#  [1] top-level scope
#    @ REPL[17]:1</code></pre>
<p>See, we’ve <strong>encoded in the type system</strong> the idea that adding the value of two different currencies doesn’t make sense.
Likewise, if you try to multiply two currencies (even if they are the same), we have not written any code to do that, and so you will get an error: Handy as it makes no sense to multiply currencies, so we should build systems where you just cannot do that.
That’s what makes this approach superior to just using basic numeric types and hoping for the best: the type system stops you from representing things that don’t make sense.</p>
<p>Aside: If we wanted to be fancy, we could have overloaded the <code>Base.:+</code> function, so we could just write <code>gbp1 + gbp2</code> and get back a <code>Gbp</code> typed value.</p>
</div>
<div id="compiled-but-with-a-repl" class="section level2">
<h2>Compiled but with a REPL</h2>
<p>I love working with R, but so often I wish that I had an easier way to share a program I write with someone who doesn’t have R installed on their machine.
At the moment, my options are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Just share outputs in the form of a Quarto or Rmarkdown rendered document</li>
<li>A Shiny app (but then I need to figure out how to host and share the app)</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be great to be able to compile the program down into an executable and then share that.</p>
<p>However, I’d never want to be in the position where we have a development cycle like C/C++/Rust.
I’d never want to lose the REPL.</p>
<p>‘REPL’ stands for “Read, Eval, Print, Loop”, if you’ve ever used R or Python at their console, you’ve used a REPL.
It’s an interactive way of working with a programming language, almost like a conversation:
You enter some code, the computer reads it, evaluates it, and prints the response, then you do the whole thing over again.</p>
<p>This REPL-driven approach is key for a data science language.
The ability to try calculations out, explore data and plots is vital to actuarial work.</p>
<p>So I would like an approach like Haskell: Have a REPL available as a key part of the workflow, but when we want, we can compile to an executable that doesn’t require the language run time to execute.</p>
</div>
<div id="fast-for-numerical-calculations" class="section level2">
<h2>Fast for Numerical Calculations</h2>
<p>Actuaries are required to build more and more complex models that output results in shorter and shorter time frames.</p>
<p>Capital modelling for general insurers’ internal models are simulation models at their heart, but to get reliable results, you need to be simulating around 100,000 simulations minimum.
It’s not unheard of for several million simulation paths to be needed.</p>
<p>That means that calculations need to run fast. But Python and R are not fast.</p>
<p>It’s common for general insurers to use proprietary systems and languages for capital models, and Aviva <a href="https://juliahub.com/case-studies/aviva/">used Julia</a> for their Solvency II model.</p>
<p>Just being compiled doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a fast language, but this hypothetical actuarial language would have to be fast.</p>
<p>That would also require decent array manipulation features.
Perhaps some sort of in-build APL DSL would be useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="modules" class="section level2">
<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>In R, there are no private functions, or private fields of a data structure.
There are functions that aren’t exported from a package, but those are just three colons away from the user.
This has pros and cons.</p>
<p>Some of the pros include:
- If the developer hasn’t made a getter for some piece of data buried deep in the data structure you’re using, there’s no problem, you can just delve in there and get it yourself
- Many things are implemented just as lists, so you can always use the list accessing methods you already know.
- If you need to use an internal function that a package uses but doesn’t export (e.g. it does part of an exported process, but exactly the sub-part you want to do elsewhere {e.g. <code>reprex::prex()</code>}), you can just grab that<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The cons include:
- You can’t hide implementation details, so you get leaky abstractions
- You can’t enforce conditions that certain types are <em>only</em> created with a constructor that checks the inputs. For example, in R, a linear model is <em>anything</em> with a <code>class</code> attribute vector containing the string <code>"lm"</code>. That means anyone can create malformed objects.</p>
<p>If we’re building systems that are meant to last and be robust, we need a way to delineate between public code (i.e. that other parts of the program or the user may interact with) and private code (e.g. helper functions that should only be called by other code within a certain conceptual boundary).
Many languages do this with modules where the developer may export only a subset of data structures and functions, keeping the rest inaccessible from outside the module.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this makes code more stable as it limits the unexpected behaviour that can happen in the more ‘Wild West’ of the R world.</p>
</div>
<div id="at-the-right-level-of-abstraction" class="section level2">
<h2>At the right level of Abstraction</h2>
<p>I’ve been learning Rust a bit recently.
I like it, but it would be a bad pattern for wide-scale actuarial use.
It’s too low level for what actuaries need to do.</p>
<p>Actuarial programmers shouldn’t need to worry about how values are stored in memory.
There should be access hatches available to tweak <em>if needed</em>, but it shouldn’t be so top-of-mind as it is for Rust developers.</p>
<p>Instead, the most common layer of working should be at the layer of the domain, or one step down in data structures like vectors, lists and data frames.</p>
</div>
<div id="batteries-included" class="section level2">
<h2>Batteries Included</h2>
<p>The concept of the data frame started in S and R, entered the Python world with pandas, and now almost every data science platform will work in data frames.</p>
<p>Actuaries tend to work mostly with structured, tabular data.
Having a data frame in the language as standard is an absolute must.
It shouldn’t be in a library, but rather a core part of the language; data frames should be available right from when you open the IDE to get to work (as they are in R).</p>
<p>Similarly, statistical functions and distributions should be available without calling any other code.
This should include all the standard distributions in R, but also fat tailed distributions like th pareto.</p>
<p>Additionally, a dedicated time series data structure should also be available without extra libraries.</p>
<p>This isn’t intended to be a general-purpose language.
The features that an actuary needs should be at their finger tips.</p>
<p>I’d also want to see native integration with Excel (no more {rJava}, please).
This should cover reading data from Excel, but also writing data to Excel in a way that doesn’t mess up an existing spreadsheet.
Ideally you would be able to reach into a spreadsheet and have a code-based way of manipulating anything you could usually by opening up Excel properly.
Unfortunately, Excel is here to stay, but perhaps there are better ways to work with it.</p>
<p>Hopefully, though, Excel’s use will diminish and more actuaries will be comfortable working with databases.
Therefore, it should be easy to connect to, read from, and write to a database.
I love R’s {dbplyr} integration with data bases; writing the same code to query a database as I write to query local data frame is a wonderful user experience.
And while I’ve not learnt too much about it, Rust’s promise of <em>compile-time</em> type-checked SQL queries is really intriguing.</p>
<p>Finally, no actuarial languge would be complete without native data visualisation features.
I’d like to see a grammar of graphics approach be the primary way of producing graphics.
I’ve often said I’ve never seen a better graphing library than {ggplot2}, I’d like something similar in the actuarial language.</p>
</div>
<div id="package-management" class="section level2">
<h2>Package Management</h2>
<p>There will, however, be times where additional or niche functionality is required.
There should be a robust package management system in place.</p>
<p>It should be easy to install and incorporate code from other people.</p>
<p>I would, of course, prefer that all development in this language would be open source, but it would be likely that individual companies would want to develop their own, in-house, code.</p>
<p>Any package manager would need to be able to pull packages from public repositories <em>and</em> internal, private ones.
It should be seamless.</p>
<p>There are many examples of successful package systems from many languages.
I like CRAN, but it’s got its own tensions, perhaps something like the GitHub-backed system of Julia, or crates.io for Rust.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-management" class="section level2">
<h2>Project Management</h2>
<p>But even with a robust package manager, it’s important to be reproducible.
<em>Project</em> management should be a built-in part of the language.</p>
<p>This is important both for compiled executables, but also non-compiled analysis code.
We need to be able to return to a project carried out a few years ago, but still be able to re-run the code and produce similar results.</p>
<p>I like how Julia does this with the <code>manifest.toml</code> file, or the ease of having something like <code>cargo</code> when working in Rust.
I’d like to see a similar system, where we can note down all the packages used, along with the specific version of the package and save that persistently, that also handles building or running our program and handles loading everything into a REPL for interactive development.</p>
<p>This should be a built-in feature and not like R’s <code>renv</code> package or whatever Python is using these days.</p>
<p>Robust project management and versioning of dependencies really is a requirement for compliance with Actuarial Standards, in my view.</p>
</div>
<div id="documentation" class="section level2">
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>I would like to see documentation being a key feature as well.</p>
<p>Both a slick way to get help documentation of the code you use, but also a easy tools to write documentation for the code you write.</p>
<p>Perhaps a flag on the compiler that public functions without documentation would fail the build.
Maybe tools for <code>pkgdown</code>-style documentation websites.
I’d like the experience writing documentation to be so easy and useful that you would never write code without documenting it.</p>
<p>I’d like this to extend out to beyond just functions in a way that R does really well with articles and vignettes.
Documenting the intention behind the code, or the purpose of the analysis.</p>
<p>One way to do this would be with Quarto integration, and other tools for literate programming.</p>
<p>This would also extend to the reading experience of the help documentation in the REPL.
Miles McBain has done some really interesting work on his package <a href="https://github.com/milesmcbain/rmdocs">rmdocs</a> that injects R’s bulit in help into an Rmarkdown document so you can run the code right there in the help.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-nulls" class="section level2">
<h2>No Nulls</h2>
<p>It’s been said that Nulls were a “billion dollar mistake”.</p>
<p>The issue is that NULL, by definition, carries almost no information.
If you get a NULL, you don’t know whether that means something went wrong, or that you’re missing data.
If you’re missing data, is it because you dropped it, or you never had it in the first place?
You just can’t tell from <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<p>Haskell, Rust, and many other functional languages use ADTs to avoid the need to have a NULL.
You encode the concepts of missing into the type system with a richer set of types, namely <code>Maybe</code> or <code>Option</code> types.
Errors are also handled in the type system with <code>Either</code>s or <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> types.</p>
<p>The actuarial language would do something similar.</p>
</div>
<div id="modelling-capabilities" class="section level2">
<h2>Modelling Capabilities</h2>
<p>It should be easy to define statistical and mathematical models in a way that’s as close to the actual mathematical approach as possible.
I really like <a href="https://turinglang.org/v0.24/">Turing</a>’s use of Julia’s macro system to enable writing Bayesian models in Julia in a way that very closely matches the way they are written in papers.</p>
<p>Similarly, R’s formula syntax for defining statistical relationships is really very powerful.</p>
<p>These both point to the requirement to have a macro system in the language, with the ability to define domain-specific languages for when the need arises.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I said at the start, I’m not expecting this language to ever be made.
It’s sitting at an intersection of niche fields.
Nevertheless, thinking about features you’d want in an ideal world, helps you pick the right tool from what’s offered in the real world.</p>
<p>I know R and Python are pretty embedded in the Actuarial world, but I really wonder what the next 20 years may bring.
I hope it’s more like what I’ve set out above, and not just interacting with LLMs.</p>
