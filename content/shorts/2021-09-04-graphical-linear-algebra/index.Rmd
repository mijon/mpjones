I'm reading Fong and Spivak's [An Invitation to Applied Category Theory](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-invitation-to-applied-category-theory/D4C5E5C2B019B2F9B8CE9A4E9E84D6BC) at the moment.
It's a wonderful read; challenging in places but clearly written. 
The subject matter is fascinating.

One of the additional resources in listed in Chapter 4 is Pawel Sobocinski's website, https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/. This is a take on linear algebra that I've not seen before and, along with Fong and Spivak's book, it's got me thinking about the power of constructing diagramatic languages to solve problems. 

I'm only a few parts through, but so far I would really recommend taking a look to anyone interested in linear algebra, category theory or new takes on familar mathematics.
