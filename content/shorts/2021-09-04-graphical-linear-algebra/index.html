<p>I’m reading Fong and Spivak’s <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-invitation-to-applied-category-theory/D4C5E5C2B019B2F9B8CE9A4E9E84D6BC">An Invitation to Applied Category Theory</a> at the moment.
It’s a wonderful read; challenging in places but clearly written.
The subject matter is fascinating.</p>
<p>One of the additional resources in listed in Chapter 4 is Pawel Sobocinski’s website, <a href="https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/" class="uri">https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/</a>. This is a take on linear algebra that I’ve not seen before and, along with Fong and Spivak’s book, it’s got me thinking about the power of constructing diagramatic languages to solve problems.</p>
<p>I’m only a few parts through, but so far I would really recommend taking a look to anyone interested in linear algebra, category theory or new takes on familar mathematics.</p>
