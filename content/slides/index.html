title: Talks I've done
type: blog

<p>Here is a list of the slides for talks I’ve published.
Generally I will try to write a blog post to accompany the talk where I think there’s something worth saying.</p>
<p>My presentation style is focussed on around simple slides with a single idea on each without too much text, so as stand-alone documents, they may be less clear.
I think slides are meant to support a live, in-person talk.</p>
