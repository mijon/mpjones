      <description>Introduction I love open source software. I love the intentions behind it, I love the range of tools available and I love the community. But for me, the best thing about open source is spotting something impressive and being able to find out how it was done.
Reading the source written by a better1 programmer to learn from is such a powerful tool to improve your own code. Iâ€™m an okay programmer, I get by, but I want to be better.</description>
